# Morrison-Java
All the assignments I completed in intro to computer science under Dr. Morrison's Java class. This includes basic
things from for loops and function defintions to complex graphical interfaces. Points of interest include
animateframe, curve, nitpad, and web browser. 

This shows my AnimateFrame. Just a basic representation of animating a moving object.

This is a notepad I created in Java. Has save and load feature.
